## Setup
 - Ensure yarn is installed (https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
 - Ensure serverless is installed (https://serverless.com/)
 - Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/SpartanLabs/mindless-aws-lambda-sample-app.git`)
 - Install all required packages (`yarn`)

## Running the application
 - Run the app locally with `serverless offline`
 
## App explanation
This currently contains two routes:

`/param1/:param1/param2/:param2` - get

and

`/` - post

You should look and the code and figure out how the routing works, and what inputs you need to give to these two routes.
